# didnt-RTFM-GPT
Yet another chatgpt project

💩 This is just a quick and dirty version of my original archived project.
It is a tool for parsing supplied documentation and returning URLs and potentially hardcoded creds, with the help of chatgpt. 💩

## How to use
Simply supply your pdf directly, or give it an url. it will convert to PDF and parse the data.

## Setup
In your env, add API key.

# roadmap
- [] Have the data work well in typical automation flows
- [] Add support for xlsx
- [] Refactor code. currently a "just works" scenario
- [] Token optimization to break the bank less
