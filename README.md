# didnt-RTFM-GPT
Yet another chatgpt project

This is just a quick and dirty version of my original archived project.
It is a tool for parsing supplied documentation and returning URLs and potentially hardcoded creds, with the help of chatgpt.

## How to use
Simply supply your pdf directly, or give it an url. it will convert to PDF and parse the data.

## Setup
In your env, add API key.

pip install -i"https://www.reportlab.com/pypi" rlextra
